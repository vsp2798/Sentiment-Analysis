# Sentiment-Analysis

Fake news is a big problem in the digital world that is impacting and affecting millions of people every day. Misinformation makes it harder for people to know the truth about relevant events in the world they live in, and can prevent them to make informed decisions. Given the criticality of this, the aim of this project, which is also part of the “Leaders Prize: Fact or Fake News?” competition on DataCup, was to build a model that can verify a claim and flag whether it is true, partially true, or false using artificial technologies like ML algorithms and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Data extraction, processing, and cleaning unstructured text data from different web sources. 

Logistic Regression, Naive-Bayes, Support Vector Machines models were implemented to classify the labels.  

Logistic Regression showed an accuracy of 62.2% and achieved a score of 0.381795 from Data-cup competition.
