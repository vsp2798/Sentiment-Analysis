# Sentiment-Analysis

Fake news is a big problem in the digital world that is impacting and affecting millions of people every day. Misinformation makes it harder for people to know the truth about relevant events in the world they live in, and can prevent them to make informed decisions. Given the criticality of this, the aim of this project, which is also part of the “Leaders Prize: Fact or Fake News?” competition on DataCup, is to build a model that can verify a claim and flag whether it is true, partially true, or false using artificial technologies like Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and Natural Language Processing (NLP). ML and NLP are one of the main methodologies used today to automate fact- checking.
